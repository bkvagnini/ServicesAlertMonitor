Services Account Monitor (or SAM) is designed to allow network administrators to be able to monitor their network services remotely, as well as on their local network. It features (or will feature) an auditory alert, as well as an e-mail alert. Services include common port numbers for common services (so you don't have to look them up), monitoring of TCP and UDP ports, and a bunch of other stuff that I haven't thought of yet.
